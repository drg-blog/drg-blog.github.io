A sequel that delivers all that and more! Colleen Hoover’s <em>It Starts With Us</em> isn’t just a continuation of <em>It Ends With Us</em>; it’s an emotional comeback tour for fans who demanded more Lily Bloom and Atlas Corrigan. Spoiler alert: it’s worth the hype.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3GasA2IujhzBPrg0dsbdeQ.png" alt="img" style="zoom:25%;" /><p><strong>GLAIM THIS BOOK</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZON0RJ"><strong>FOR FREE FROM AMAZON</strong></a></p><p>When we last left Lily Bloom, she was picking up the pieces of her life post-divorce. Her ex-husband, Ryle Kincaid — a brooding and troubled neurosurgeon with anger management issues — was officially in her rearview mirror. Or so we thought. Lily’s priority now is her adorable daughter, Emerson (a.k.a. Emmy), and her budding career as the boss of the cutest flower shop in Boston. Life’s pretty manageable, except for one tiny problem: Ryle just won’t stay away. Between co-parenting Emmy and his lingering feelings for Lily, Ryle has more guest appearances in this book than he probably should. Spoiler: he’s still problematic.</p><p>Enter Atlas Corrigan, aka the cinnamon roll of your romantic dreams. Remember Atlas? The kind, patient, and undeniably gorgeous chef who has been Lily’s emotional anchor since their teenage years? Yeah, he’s back. And this time, he’s ready to make things official. No more waiting on the sidelines for Lily to figure things out. Atlas is here to prove that love doesn’t have to be complicated, dramatic, or, you know, violent. It can just be…nice. And sexy. Mostly sexy.</p><p>The book opens with Lily bumping into Atlas in the middle of her chaotic, flower-filled life. Sparks fly immediately, and Atlas’s invitation to dinner is the start of what should be a picture-perfect romance. Should be. Because life, as always, has other plans. For starters, Ryle’s jealousy hits new heights. Co-parenting with your ex is hard enough, but co-parenting with a jealous ex who can’t stand your new boyfriend? That’s a reality TV show waiting to happen. Ryle’s passive-aggressive comments and not-so-subtle threats create plenty of awkward moments, and let’s just say family gatherings are…tense.</p><p><strong>GLAIM THIS BOOK</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZON0RJ"><strong>FOR FREE FROM AMAZON</strong></a></p><p>But <em>It Starts With Us</em> isn’t just about Lily’s love triangle. The book also dives deeper into Atlas’s backstory. Turns out, Atlas isn’t just the perfect boyfriend — he’s also a saint. Between running his successful restaurant and dealing with the sudden appearance of a long-lost half-brother, Atlas somehow finds time to be emotionally available for Lily at every turn. His half-brother, Josh, is a sarcastic, angsty teenager who adds a touch of comic relief to the story. Watching Atlas go from “lonely guy with a tragic past” to “instant big brother” is both hilarious and heartwarming.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lily grapples with finding her voice in the face of Ryle’s manipulations. Hoover masterfully balances the heavier themes of abuse and healing with lighthearted moments that make you laugh out loud. For instance, Emmy’s toddler antics often steal the show. Whether she’s throwing spaghetti at the wall or demanding snacks at the worst possible moments, Emmy reminds us that kids are equal parts adorable and chaotic.</p><p>As Lily and Atlas’s relationship deepens, we’re treated to some truly swoon-worthy moments. Romantic rooftop dinners? Check. Handwritten love notes? Check. The kind of conversations that make you believe in soulmates? Oh, absolutely. But it’s not all roses and rainbows. Ryle’s presence looms large, and Lily’s struggle to set boundaries with him is both frustrating and relatable. You’ll find yourself cheering her on as she learns to prioritize her happiness without compromising her responsibilities as a mom.</p><p><strong>GLAIM THIS BOOK</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZON0RJ"><strong>FOR FREE FROM AMAZON</strong></a></p><p>One of the book’s standout features is its humor. Hoover has a knack for infusing even the most dramatic scenes with laugh-out-loud moments. Take, for example, the time Atlas tries to impress Emmy by cooking her a fancy meal, only for her to demand chicken nuggets instead. Or the moment Lily accidentally FaceTimes Atlas while covered in dirt from repotting plants. These little snippets of real-life awkwardness make the characters feel like old friends.</p><p>By the time the story wraps up, you’ll feel like you’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster — in the best way possible. Lily and Atlas finally get their well-deserved happy ending, complete with a few surprises that will leave you grinning like an idiot. Ryle, on the other hand, is left to confront his own demons, offering a bittersweet sense of closure.</p><p>In classic Hoover fashion, <em>It Starts With Us</em> is a masterful blend of humor, heartbreak, and hope. It’s a love story that doesn’t just make you believe in second chances — it makes you laugh, cry, and want to text your best friend about every single plot twist. Whether you’re here for the romance, the drama, or just to see Ryle get what’s coming to him, this book delivers on every level.</p><p>So, grab a box of tissues, pour yourself a glass of wine (or three), and settle in for a wild ride. Because if there’s one thing <em>It Starts With Us</em> teaches us, it’s that love — real, messy, imperfect love — is always worth fighting for.</p><p><strong>GLAIM THIS BOOK</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZON0RJ"><strong>FOR FREE FROM AMAZON</strong></a></p>]]></content>
